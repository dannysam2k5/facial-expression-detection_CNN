    "# Facial Expression Detection using Convolutional Neural Networks ü§ñüì∑\n",
    "\n",
    "Facial expression detection is a fascinating field within computer vision that involves the recognition and interpretation of human emotions based on facial expressions. In this Jupyter Notebook, we'll build a Facial Expression Detection model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). This model will be trained to classify facial expressions into different emotion categories, such as happiness, sadness, anger, etc. üòäüò¢üò†\n",
    "\n",
    "### Goal üöÄüíª\n",
    "The primary goal of this project is to create an effective facial expression detection system that can be integrated into various applications, including human-computer interaction, virtual reality, and emotion-aware technology.\n",
