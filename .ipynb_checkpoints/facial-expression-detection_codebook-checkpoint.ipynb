    "# Facial Expression Detection using Convolutional Neural Networks 🤖📷\n",
    "\n",
    "Facial expression detection is a fascinating field within computer vision that involves the recognition and interpretation of human emotions based on facial expressions. In this Jupyter Notebook, we'll build a Facial Expression Detection model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). This model will be trained to classify facial expressions into different emotion categories, such as happiness, sadness, anger, etc. 😊😢😠\n",
    "\n",
    "### Goal 🚀💻\n",
    "The primary goal of this project is to create an effective facial expression detection system that can be integrated into various applications, including human-computer interaction, virtual reality, and emotion-aware technology.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tools & Libraries 🛠️\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be using the below tools and libriaries for our implementation\n",
    "- TensorFlow: An open-source machine learning framework that includes tools for building and training deep learning models.\n",
    "- Keras: A high-level neural network API that runs on top of TensorFlow, making it easier to build and experiment with deep learning models.\n",
    "- Matplotlib: A visualisation library 📊🐍\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementation Steps\n",
    "1. **Environment setup:** \n",
    "2. **Import necessary libraries:**\n",
    "3. **Dataset collection:**\n",
    "4. **Data Augmentation & Data Generators:**\n",
    "5. **CNN model building:**\n",
    "6. **Model training:**\n",
    "7. **Model evaluation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout the notebook, we'll provide detailed explanations, code snippets and visualizations to ensure a clear understanding of the entire process. 🧠🛠️\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's get started! 🚀🚀🚀🚀"
